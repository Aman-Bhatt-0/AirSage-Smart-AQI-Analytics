# AirSage-Smart-AQI-Analytics
This project analyzes air quality data in major Indian cities (Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad) using machine learning techniques. It collects and processes real-time AQI (Air Quality Index) data, calculates pollutant-specific AQI values, and applies Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to predict PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations.
